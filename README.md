# CompTIA-Network-Guide-Book-by-Anthony-Sequeira
In this repository, I will publish summaries of each chapter from Network+ Guide Book written by Anthony Sequeira (Pearson IT Certification). Each chapter will be covered in a single .md file and you can access it directly from this repository.

I Hope this helps you in your Network+ exam and overall network knowledge.
Good luck!
